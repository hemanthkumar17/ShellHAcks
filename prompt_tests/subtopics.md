# To generate Sub-topics given a main topic that the user wants to learn

 - Write a concise course plan about an introduction course to "Programming" for students who are either starting to learn it or have covered a few topics in it. Write a list of all subtopics that will be taught each week. Remove all the course recap, projects, assignments, and quizzes from the course. Take a deep breath and think about this step by step. Now give me a list of sub-topics to include for teaching them. Give the answer in JSON format, {week: topics}

```
